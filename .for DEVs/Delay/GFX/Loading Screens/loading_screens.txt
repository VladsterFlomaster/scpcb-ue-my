			"SCP-939 are endothermic, pack-based predators which display atrophy of various systems similar to troglobitic organisms. SCP-939 average 2.2 meters tall standing upright and weigh an average of 250kg, though weight is highly variable.",
			"SCP-939's primary method of luring prey is the imitation of human speech in the voices of prior victims, though imitation of other species and active nocturnal hunts have been documented.",
			"Prey is usually killed with a single bite to the cranium or neck; bite forces have been measured in excess of 35 MPa."
